# <5-Day Weather Application>

## Description

This application utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API - Check it out [here](https://openweathermap.org/api) - to create a 5-day forecast based on a given city entered by the user. This application functions throught the use of LocalStorage and third-party APIs to give the user and accurate forecast of the next 5 days for any city entered by the user. This challenge was just that, a challenge! I learned a substantial amount about API calls and how the result data is nested for response-calling. After working with this project, I feel very confident in my ability to incorporate third-party APIs into my applications. My goal for this project was to create a simple and clean application with a little less focus on the UI, and more focus on the quality of my JavaScript. The use of LocalStorage was used to store, recall, and create the additional buttons that are created when the user performs a search. From there, the user search entry is passed through the OpenWeathermap API to call all forecast data to be displayed. During this project I struggled with a bug that caused repeating and duplicate "Search City" buttons to be created, So I had to shut off functionality. In the near future I plan to re-visit this challenge and update the UI and fix this bug.

## Installation

This application operates entirely in your browser; no installation required for use! Check out the application [here!](https://tjmomon92.github.io/Challenge-6-1.11.2023/)

## Usage

In this application, a user will simply load up the page, enter a desired city into the search bar on the left, and hit "search":

Once finished, the user's recent search history will display under the search bar, and the current 5-day weather forecast for the city will be displayed on the right-side of the page. Easy!

I would like to give a massive shoutout to my classmate Gabriel Ess for his help in expanding my knowledge of API call nesting and how to apply the responses. Check out his [Github!](https://github.com/gabess3)
